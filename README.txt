# Facial Keypoint Detector 

This deep learning model based on convolutional neural networks detects left eye , right eye and mouth from a image of a face.

The model has 7 Convolutional layers and 3 Linear layers.
Implemented with Pytorch.
Used Tensorboard for learning visualisation.

Measure -  MSELoss
Optimiser -  Adagrad 

Trained Using dataset from Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/data -"The data set for this competition was graciously provided by Dr. Yoshua Bengio of the University of Montreal."

Sample images provide model predictions versus  the true values.



Future Possible Work
1.Augmented train dataset with manual labelling of keypoints\n
2.Using advanced layers such as skip and residual nets.
